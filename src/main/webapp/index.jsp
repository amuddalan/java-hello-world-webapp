<h1>Hello DEVOPS EXOLORERS</h1>
<p> We want to compile source of language x .. No no language y… and also z, alfa, beta…gamma... etc…

Then how to install all these development kits on your host and create the packages… here is the rescue dockers … dockers.. Containers.

	 Docker/containers are just like our greatest invention use and throw plastic bags… whhhattt ? :(
	Docker containers readily available in the form of images in the dockerhub a place where all images live.
	We can avail ready made container images which suits for our requirements just like build environments.
	Or else we can take a base operating system image and customise and create our required environment image with help of Dockerfile in which we put all the instructions to configure he environment.
	 Like every tool has its own file (maven,docker,ansible) jenkins also has Jenkinsfile where we can put all the pipeline instructions.

Bring an image into your host and run a container and put your source into container and build/cook/wash and do whatever u want and
That is isolated from your host. once target is built and ready in the container take  it and kill/throw the containers into dustbin. DO U WANT TO PLAY WITH CONTAINERS....
